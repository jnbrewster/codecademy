Literal notation creates a single object. Literal notation uses curly brackets *{ }* and the object's default properties are defined within the brackets using *property:value* notation.

Constructor notation involves defining an object _constructor_. And like defining a *function*, we use the function keyword. You can think of this constructor as a "template" from which you can create multiple objects. To create a new object from a constructor, we use the *new* keyword.
