/*
Create an object constructor called StaffMember which takes two parametersâ€”name and discountPercent. And then have the (public) properties name and discountPercent equal the parameters.

To help, we have already created two employees using this constructor. Sally and Bob already have their staff discount set up: Sally getting 5% off and Bob getting 10%.

Create a new instance of the object for yourself called me with your massive staff discount bonus of 20%.

// create a constructor for the StaffMember class


var sally = new StaffMember("Sally",5);
var bob = new StaffMember("Bob",10);

//Create a StaffMember for yourself called me
var me = new StaffMember("Joel", 20);
