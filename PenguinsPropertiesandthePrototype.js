/*
Create an Emperor class that takes a single name parameter and sets its name property to be this value. Don't set a numLegs property in the constructor.

Similar to what we did in the previous exercise, make Emperor inherit from Penguin by setting the prototype of Emperor to be Penguin.

Create a new emperor object that is an instance of the Emperor class with any name you'd like. Then use console.log to print the number of legs emperor hasâ€”this should have been inherited from Penguin!
*/
function Penguin(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.numLegs = 2;
}

// create your Emperor class here and make it inherit from Penguin
function Emperor(name) {
    this.name = name;

};
Emperor.prototype = new Penguin();
// create an "emperor" object and print the number of legs it has
var emperor = new Emperor("Bob");
console.log(emperor.numLegs);
